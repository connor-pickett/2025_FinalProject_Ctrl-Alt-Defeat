# Emotional Penalties and Performance in the NFL

## Research Question  
Do NFL teams commit more emotional penalties (e.g., unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct) in high-stakes games, such as playoff games or rivalry matchups? Additionally, how does a player's performance change immediately after committing an emotional penalty?  

## Data Description  
This project is still in development, and the exact data we will analyze may change as we refine our approach. Below are some key data points we are considering:  

- **Game Context**  
  - Regular season vs. playoff game  
  - Rivalry vs. non-rivalry game  
  - Home vs. away game  

- **Penalty Data**  
  - Type of penalty (e.g., unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct)  
  - Time in the game when penalty occurred  
  - Player committing the penalty  
  - Team committing the penalty  

- **Performance Metrics (Before and After a Penalty)**  
  - Player stats before and after committing a penalty (e.g., yards gained, completion percentage, tackles, sacks)  
  - Team performance after an emotional penalty (e.g., drive success rate, score changes)  

- **Fan Interaction (if available)**  
  - Crowd noise impact on penalties (home vs. away teams)  
  - Influence of game location on penalty frequency  

These variables are subject to change as we explore the dataset further and refine our research focus.
